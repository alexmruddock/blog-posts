### Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a ubiquitous part of modern life, transforming industries from healthcare to finance. At its core, AI involves machines learning from data. But what guides this learning? The answer lies in what we call an 'objective function'. This post explores this foundational concept and its implications for AI development.

### The Concept of the Objective Function

An objective function in AI is akin to a destination in a journey. It's a predefined criterion that guides the learning process. In AI models, this function quantifies the goal, whether it's recognizing faces in images or translating languages. The AI 'learns' by adjusting its parameters to optimize this function.

### Historical Perspective

AI's journey began with simple goals. Early models focused on specific, narrow tasks like playing chess or solving mathematical problems. These tasks had clear objectives, like winning a game or finding the correct answer, making it easier to measure the success of the AI.

### Why Singular Objectives?

Singular objectives dominated early AI for several reasons:

- **Simplicity**: They were easier to define and implement.
- **Measurability**: Success or failure could be clearly quantified.
- **Compatibility**: Early applications of AI required straightforward solutions to well-defined problems.

### Limitations and Real-World Application Challenges

However, this simplicity is also a limitation. Singular objectives often oversimplify complex situations. For example, an AI designed to maximize click-through rates on ads may neglect ethical considerations. The real world is rarely so black-and-white, and AI needs to account for this complexity.

### Transitioning to a Multidimensional Approach

As AI applications become more sophisticated, addressing complex, real-world problems, the need for multidimensional objective functions is becoming clear. These functions consider multiple, sometimes conflicting, goals â€“ a topic that will be explored further in this series.

### Conclusion

Singular objective functions have been fundamental in AI's evolution, offering a clear, measurable way to guide learning. However, as we push the boundaries of what AI can do, we see the need for a more nuanced approach that reflects the complexity of the world we live in.
