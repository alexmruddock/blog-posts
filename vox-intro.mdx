# **Introduction**

2023 was turbulent.

2024 will be no different.

I suspect we’ll see even more disruption in the world of tech. Market dynamics are shifting rapidly, and customer expectations are changing weekly. Innovation will not be slowing down anytime soon, and businesses face the challenge of moving successfully through what has become a high entropy environment.

Like us, businesses must bolster their immune systems to adapt to threats and changing conditions. A term for this concept was coined by Nassim Nicholas Taleb: Antifragile. Antifragility goes beyond resilience; it’s about gaining from disorder and emerging not just alive but stronger.

I’ve been thinking a lot about a framework I’ve used as a Product Manager and Product Marketer. I call it **VoX,** which stands for **Voice of X.**

Where X =

- customers
- partners
- developers
- employees
- peers
- investors
- suppliers
- etc.

VoX is a holistic approach to listening to and leveraging feedback from various stakeholders. The process enables you to capture insights from diverse and important sources and move towards a better understanding of ground truth in your organization, your market, and the broader landscape in which you must operate.

# **The Cycle**

It follows a simple repeating cycle:

1. **Request:** Identify a piece of VoX you or a colleague needs. This can be a request from a peer or something you initiate. Think product feedback, a testimonial, a customer experience survey, etc.
2. **Recruit:** Generate and target a CTA to the person whose VoX you wish to capture.
3. **Capture:** Obtain and store the raw materials: a survey completion, a recorded video, a screen share of them using a feature, etc.
4. **Curate:** Mine and analyze the raw materials collected from sources and look for insights, ideas, and social proof.
5. **Produce:** Combine the elements into an asset. E.g., a download for the product team or a marketing/sales asset to help convince buyers.
6. **Distribute:** Put the asset in front of the group that needs to see it — your leadership team, your product team, your potential buyer, etc.
7. **Measure:** Whatever the asset's intended use, you must measure it. It could be the success of new products that come to market, the improvements in retention based on better pricing, or new sales attributed to powerful assets. ***NOTE**Do not just attribute revenue to the asset itself but also to the source(s) of VoX that helped to provide it — this helps you identify the most valuable sources of VoX for future cycles.
8. **Re****engage:** This is really about two things. First, tell the source of VoX what their impact has been, and second, ask them for more. It’s easy to overdo it, so make sure you know when they were last engaged, and don’t be afraid to offer an incentive if requests are arriving close together.

# **Product Management Example:**

- **Request**: A designer wants feedback on a new set of designs.
- **Recruit**: I generate a targeted CTA for customers with a known history of participation.
- **Capture**: I capture their responses to the prototype by having them upload a video or answer a survey.
- **Curate**: I look through the submissions and remove any information that is superfluous or not important.
- **Produce**: I turn this into a package for my designer containing visualizations for survey data and an edited video with the key insights from customers.
- **Distribute**: I send this to my designer, fellow members of the product team, and engineers who work on this part of the application — it’s important that all of these stakeholders benefit from the insights generated.
- **Measure**: We decide to implement a few findings based on the VoX process and now need to determine the impact. One way to do this is qualitative feedback — getting the customer's input on the modifications and measuring their sentiment. Another way is to examine the success of the modifications in the built feature by using an A/B test with a tool like Optimizely. For the big stuff, you should do both.
- **Re-engage**: We want participants to know their contributions matter so we can close the loop. This may even mean giving them a shout-out in your new feature announcement.

# **Product Marketing Example:**

- **Request**: Sales wants testimonials and case studies for their presentations.
- **Recruit**: I generate a targeted CTA for customers with a positive sentiment in the verticals the sales team is most interested in.
- **Capture**: I capture their responses by having them complete a digital process in which they answer questions that allow us to craft a story.
- **Curate**: I look through the submissions and remove any that don’t suit the sales team's needs.
- **Produce**: I turn this into a series of assets.
- **Distribute**: I send this to my marketing and sales teams to use as material.
- **Measure**: We add these assets to marketing campaigns and use them in sales calls. We determine the revenue impact of these assets by measuring their influence on closed-won deals. We then attribute these dollars back to their original source, the advocates that gave us the VoX.
- **Re-engage**: We want to celebrate those who have helped us. This may mean sending them a coffee or a lunch or something more personal based on what we know they like — something good CSMs will keep tabs on.

# **The Stack (Not An Exhaustive List)**

2. **Recruit:** Gainsight PX, Hubspot, Influitive, LinkedIn, Marketo, Pendo, WalkMe, etc.
3. **Capture:** Alida, Influitive, ProductBoard, Qualtrics, ShoutOut, SlapFive, TechValidate, UserEvidence, etc.
4. **Curate:** Alida, Influitive, Domo, Looker, ProductBoard, PowerBI, Qualtrics, TechValidate, UserEvidence, etc.
5. **Produce:** Adobe Suite, Canva, Final Cut Pro, Google Slides, Keynote, PowerPoint, ShoutOut, Upshot
6. **Distribute:** Docsend, Highspot, Hootsuite, Hubspot, Influitive, LinkedIn, Marketo, PostBeyond, Seismic
7. **Measure:** Adobe, Alida, Dreamdata, Gainsight PX, Google Analytics, Highspot, Hubspot, Influitive, Marketo, Pendo, PostBeyond, Salesforce, Seismic, WalkMe
8. **Re****engage:** Alida, Catalyst, Influitive, Gainsight, Salesforce

# **AI’s Expanding Role in VoX**

I would be remiss if I didn’t point out the obvious. AI is going to make all of this easier. Let’s use an example to illustrate the point. Today, it is possible to do the following:

- CS rep sends a message in Slack asking about the recent sentiment of customers.
- Automatically generate a survey with your GenAI tool of choice (let’s use GPT-4 in this example).
- Place that survey in front of a customer with AI-powered targeting, perhaps by generating and sending a custom email just for them.
- Capture the responses to that survey and automatically close it after an allotted period (perhaps a week).
- Curate the insights in the survey by giving GPT-4 the prompt to hunt for key insights.
- Automatically generate a PDF or slide deck with the information and synthesis.
- Send these insights to the original requester and anyone who may benefit from the information. In this example, that might be the CS team, CX team, Product Team, etc.
- Measurement/analysis of quantitative data is easier with AI by leveraging tools like Excel with Co-Pilot or ChatGPT with Code Interpreter, and other BI tools can’t be far behind. I predict things like Looker and Tableau will have natural language querying and dashboard building before the year ends.

# **Building Anti-Fragility (Your Business’ Immune System) with VoX**

- **Adaptive Learning**: VoX enables your business to learn and adapt from every interaction and piece of feedback. This ability to quickly pivot and evolve based on real-time insights is crucial to understanding our rapidly changing environments.
- **Proactive Innovation**: Feedback from stakeholders often highlights areas for improvement and innovation. By being attuned to this feedback, your business can proactively develop solutions that meet current needs and anticipate future trends.
- **Diverse Perspectives**: By considering the voices of different stakeholders, you avoid echo chambers. This diversity in feedback ensures you and your teams don’t miss important factors when trying to make decisions.

# **Gaining Competitive Advantage**

- **Market Insight**: VoX provides insights into market trends and customer preferences, enabling you to stay ahead of the curve and differentiate your offerings.
- **Better Positioning**: Use VoX to build more accurate representations of the mental models of key stakeholders. Leverage their own language and pain points to inform how you market and position your offerings.
- **Customer Advocacy**: Satisfied customers are a renewable resource that provide high-quality leads, testimonials, product reviews, and references. Their endorsements and social proof are powerful marketing and sales tools that elevate your brand above competitors.

# **Conclusion**

Incorporating VoX into your business strategy is more than just a customer feedback mechanism; it’s a transformative approach that makes your business antifragile and more competitive. By embracing the diverse voices of your stakeholders, you can adapt, innovate, and grow in ways that not only respond to market changes but also anticipate and shape them. Make VoX a cornerstone of your strategy, and watch as it drives your business toward sustainable success in an ever-changing landscape.
